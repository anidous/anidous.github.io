This is the first post.  I don't know if I'll stop or continue but I think an outlet for my thoughts would be good to have.  The topics will be anything I'm interested in at the moment but probably it will be mostly about programming, language learning, money and health.  So I guess part of this will be a log and part of this will be a snapshot on a younger version of myself's mind.

Maybe something will come out of doing this.
