About me:
    I hate learning things.  I love knowing things.  You can't be good at the second without doing the first.  I'm learning languages.  I program things for a living.  Cryptography, Stenography, video and the web are what interest me right now.  This doesn't give you much to go on to find out who I am which is the point.  There's probably some psychosis going on but I have no idea.  It doesn't matter too much considering everyone is a little crazy in their own way.
